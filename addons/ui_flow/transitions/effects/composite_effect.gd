## Composite effect — plays multiple effects simultaneously.
##
## Effects run in parallel. Each effect manages its own tween.
## Supports nesting: CompositeEffect can contain SequencedEffect and vice versa.
##
## Usage:
## [codeblock]
## var composite = UIFlowCompositeEffect.new()
## composite.effects = [
##     UIFlowFadeEffect.new(),
##     UIFlowScaleEffect.create(Vector2(0.8, 0.8)),
## ]
## composite.duration = 0.3
## [/codeblock]
class_name UIFlowCompositeEffect extends UIFlowTransitionEffect

## Array of UIFlowTransitionEffect to play simultaneously.
